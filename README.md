This is the source code for the app Check Off. The app can be accessed online at https://check-off.herokuapp.com/.

The app offers several functionalities: 
- Add a new item: by clicking the '+' button, the user can add a new item to their to-do list.
- Edit an item: users can edit a to-do item's title by clicking the pencil icon
- Check-off an item: users can mark an item completed by clicking the checkbox for that item. They can also un-check and item if they wish to. 
- Delete an item: an item can be removed by clicking the trash icon. 

We also have a sorting feature, that can sort by status (incomplete first), date created, and date last edited.
